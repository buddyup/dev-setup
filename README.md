Buddyup Dev Machine Setup
=================

Run this:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buddyup/dev-setup/master/setup.sh)
```

When it's done, reboot, and run it again, just to make sure it's done.




## Background:

This setup script is a stripped down version of this repo: https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup

Lots of details and screenshots there if you're curious, but you shouldn't need them.
