Four steps:

2. Reboot.
3. Run it again.
4. Reboot.  You're done!





## Background:

This setup script is a stripped down version of this repo: https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup

Lots of details and screenshots there if you're curious, but you shouldn't need them.


Broadly, we use docker, and [docker-os-x](https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev) for file-syncing goodness.
